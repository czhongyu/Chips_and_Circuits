# Chips_and_Circuits

/map:
    Two prints stored in coordinate.
    Left lower corner is defined as (0, 0)
    
 - what makes the problem difficult?
 - randomly generate enough solutions, 
 draw a graph to get upper/lower bound of cost and average cost
 - function to get the shortest path
 
 
 
 - states base (amount of solutions) 
 (estimate upper-bound, lower-bound)!!!
 - bfs: get valid solutions
 - python visualization: plotly, bokeh (just a empty one first)
