# Chips_and_Circuits

/map:
    Two prints stored in coordinate.
    Left lower corner is defined as (0, 0)
    
 - what makes the problem difficult?
 - randomly generate enough solutions, 
 draw a graph to get upper/lower bound of cost and average cost
 
 - states base (amount of solutions) 
 (estimate upper-bound, lower-bound)!!!
 
 - wires are not allowed to pass by all the other gates
 - what are the wires that should be taken out?
 - visualize incomplete grid, find the problem, try to write heuristics to prevent it
 - remove unconnected gates!
 - info showed in a graph???
 - keep track of the time used
 - run the algorithm for a day
 
 - randomly take one wire, try to connect the shortest option and pierce through all (some?) the other wires
 - ppa
 
 - argparse
 - choose netlist, algorithms, no need for other variables
 
presentation
 - introduction: make sure everyone understand your case, constrain 
 - states base, bound, 
 - methods to solve, how to solve, the algorithms used,
 explain them 
 - experiment
 - result, cost, what they looks like, explain
 - conclusion: comparison, explain why it's better (algorithm and case)
 - what makes it difficult?
 - future research that can be done? why the algorithms are suitable for solve our case
